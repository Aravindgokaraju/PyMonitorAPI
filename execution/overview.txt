Data will be in json format. See sample_data
Read data to get commands which will be executed in order according to the json.
Find Commands in the actions/next parts of the steps will add criteria to the stack to be executed.
Criteria may not be nececcary and might be an extra layer from extracting commands from db to execution but having an object in the middle allows for future flexibility
Criteria WILL have a WebElement property that will be populated when the parent runs its next section. should be overwritten with find action, 
    or have the option of overwriting with find action only if something goes wrong
When a parent calls find on the next, populate the next criteria's webElement with the parent's next by default.
